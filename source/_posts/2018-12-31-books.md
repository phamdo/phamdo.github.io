After finishing school in May, I have had more time for myself, which allowed
me to fall in love with reading again. I decided to compile a list of the
books that I have read this year. I hope that you can find some decent
suggestions, and I hope to create another reading list in 2019!

This book was really good and it taught me how to form a habit of running and
jogging which was my goal. I also really liked how it talked about psychology
and economics and more. The stories he tells are really interesting and I was
able to learn about a lot of different topics. And yeah I really like it
overall so yea
