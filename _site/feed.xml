        <title>My 2018 Reading List</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing school in May, I have had more time for myself, which allowed
me to fall in love with reading again. I decided to compile a list of the
books that I have read this year. I hope that you can find some decent
suggestions, and I hope to create another reading list in 2019!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;book&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-12-31/duhigg.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;booktitle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/b&gt; by Charles Duhigg&lt;/div&gt;
Rating: 
&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-star-full&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-star-full&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-star-full&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-star-full&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-star-half&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book was really good and it taught me how to form a habit of running and
jogging which was my goal. I also really liked how it talked about psychology
and economics and more. The stories he tells are really interesting and I was
able to learn about a lot of different topics. And yeah I really like it
overall so yea 
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Trip to Seattle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt; Over spring break, Jake and I embarked on our first trip across the
country to one of my favorite cities - Seattle! Our first stop was the 
Seattle Space Needle, which is currently being renovated to an all 
glass design. Luckily, it was open to the public during the short time we 
were visiting. Even though we were surrounded by construction and missed out
on the iconic rotating restaurant, it was really cool to see the Space Needle
during a significant time in its history. The view of the city from the 
observation deck definitely did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/needle-view.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Next, we visited the Chihuly Garden and Glass museum. This was
my favorite attraction included in the Seattle City Pass. I was extremely 
impressed by the glass blowing demonstration, where we got to observe the 
entire process of creating a glass bowl. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/glass.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The next day, we went to the Seattle Aquarium. It was nothing new for me
since I had been there before, but I did enjoy watching the cute sea otters. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/wheel.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Afterwards, we decided to take a ride on the Great Wheel. It seemed a little
pricey at first, but we got to spin around 4 or 5 times. I think it was worth
it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/wheel-selfie.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I really enjoyed the beautiful views of the city skyline and the 
waterfront. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/wheel-view.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We also went on the Argosy Harbor Cruise. This was the perfect activity to
take a break after a long day of walking and get a lot of cool photos of
Seattle from the water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/boat-view.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Of course, we had to visit Pike Place Market and try bunch of different
foods. I had the award-winning New England Clam Chowder from Pike Place Chowder,
and Jake had a pork bun (char siu bao) from Mee Sum. We also tried some 
delicious pastry goods from Piroshky Piroshky, a Russian bakery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The following day, we went to the Woodland Park Zoo. It was actually quite
an impressive zoo with a lot of animals. I also learned a fun fact: adult penguins
have a stripe on their neck, while chicks do not!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/zoo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; That afternoon, we went to the Seattle Japanese Garden. It was really pretty
and the weather was absolutely gorgeous, which was surprising since it was
snowing back home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-03-22/garden.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of the biggest highlights of our trip was eating dinner at Din
Tai Fung. They are famous for their delicious soup dumplings (xiao long bao),
and they definitely live up to the hype. Honestly, this restaurant may or may not have
been the main reason why I wanted to come to Seattle in the first place... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On the final day of our trip, we did Bill Spiedel's Underground Tour.
I highly recommend this tour if you are interested in learning about the
history of Seattle. It was extremely interesting and entertaining, and our tour
guide told a lot of funny stories. We spent the remainder of the day 
wandering around the International District. It was a pretty good day, 
because Jake got the amazing news that he passed his job interview and was 
being offered a job! We celebrated by eating Thai style hot pot for dinner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I had such an amazing time on this trip. I attempted travel journaling
for the first time, and I am so grateful that I documented everything, because 
I  definitely don't want to forget these memories. I had so much fun and 
I can't wait for my next adventure! &lt;/p&gt;
